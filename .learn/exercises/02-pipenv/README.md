# Installation

Over the internet (or in previous exercises at 4Geeks) you will be reading about pip, the python package manager, and `virtual env` a virtualization tool that helps to better organize your python projects.

On this tutorial we will be using [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) that is basically a combination of `PIP`+`Virtual Env`.

## Why pipenv?

We think that pipenv is the evolution of pip, it handles your project packages easily allowing your to focus on other things, without pipenv you will have to take some time to maintain your packages.

### Pipenv installation

First thing, you have to install pipenv if you have not already. If you are completing this tutorial on Gitpod you must not worry because pipenv is probably already installed. 

### The terminal

If you cannot see the terminal on the bottom of the screen you can open a new one by looking at the terminal menu: 

```
terminal -> new terminal
```
